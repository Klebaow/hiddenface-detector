# hiddenface-detector
This project aims to develop a back-end system, based on computer vision, to automatically detect whether a person is using any type of facial covering with the intention of hiding their identity. This includes items such as balaclavas, helmets, costume masks, scarves, among other objects that fully or partially obstruct the face.
