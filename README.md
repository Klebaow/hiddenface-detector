# 🕵️‍♂️ facial_concealment – Facial Concealment Detection via Computer Vision

## 🧾 Project Description
This project aims to develop a back-end system using computer vision techniques to automatically detect whether a person is intentionally covering their face to conceal their identity. This includes items such as balaclavas, helmets, costume masks, scarves, or any object that significantly hides facial features. The system is intended for use in surveillance, security, and monitoring applications, particularly in public spaces or controlled environments.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Detect the presence of intentional facial concealment in images or video frames
- Build a RESTful API to process and classify submitted media
- Achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between concealed and visible faces
- Deliver a real-time solution focused purely on back-end development

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLOv5 / YOLOv8 / MobileNet (model experimentation)
- FastAPI (for API development)
- Google Colab (for prototyping and training)

## 📂 Dataset Strategy
- Curated datasets containing images of individuals with and without facial concealment
- Use of public datasets like:
  - [MaskedFace-Net](https://github.com/cabani/MaskedFace-Net)
  - [MFDD](https://github.com/X-zhangyang/Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset)
  - [WIDER FACE](http://shuoyang1213.me/WIDERFACE/)
- Additional custom dataset collection for helmets, balaclavas, fantasy masks, etc.

## 🚧 Project Roadmap
1. Define project scope and research objectives ✅  
2. Dataset research and curation 🔄  
3. Model training and evaluation  
4. API implementation with FastAPI  
5. System testing and optimizations  
6. Documentation and final demo  

## 🧪 Expected Results
- Classification accuracy ≥ 90%
- Inference time ≤ 200ms per image
- Fully functional REST API for external integration
